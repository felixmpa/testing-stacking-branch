I want to build a simple typescript app using https://bun.sh/; this app is about scalping or swing trading by connecting to the Poloniex API.

- This app must use a sandbox wallet so as not to lose real money, but it must connect to real trading. This will all be a test run until the bot becomes reliable at some point and we see that it's generating profits. Then we'll switch to the real wallet.

- Each API or data usage must be live and always run with the bot.
